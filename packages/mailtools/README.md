# @u22n/mailtools

`@u22n/mailtools` is a modified and more feature filled version of [`tempo-email-parser`](https://github.com/yourtempo/tempo-email-parser).

We picked up on `tempo-email-parser` which was not being maintained any more and updated it to modern tooling and dependencies. We are using this package at uninbox.com, but everyone is allowed to use it as they want.

## Notes

- The original package didn't pass all of the tests. We haven't implemented missing features till now. But we plan to do that soon. Note that features like Quote Stripping doesn't work.
- Implement all the features and test cases if needed
